## 0.1.6
- fix: parse SSE-wrapped JSON-RPC responses (Streamable HTTP servers may answer POST with text/event-stream, e.g. mcp.deepwiki.com) — found by cross-validating against a live registry server
- fix: CLI-reported inspectorVersion now follows package.json instead of a stale constant

# Changelog
